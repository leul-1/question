            { q: "What is the active site of an enzyme?", a: "Where substrate binds", options: ["Where substrate binds", "Where inhibitors attach", "Where energy is stored", "Where proteins are made"], reason: "The active site is where the substrate fits and undergoes a reaction." },
            { q: "Which factor does NOT affect enzyme activity?", a: "Magnetism", options: ["Temperature", "pH", "Substrate concentration", "Magnetism"], reason: "Magnetism does not influence enzyme activity, unlike temperature and pH." },
            { q: "What happens when an enzyme is denatured?", a: "Loses its function", options: ["Works better", "Becomes stronger", "Loses its function", "Becomes an energy source"], reason: "Denaturation alters enzyme structure, preventing it from functioning." },
            { q: "What is a substrate?", a: "The molecule an enzyme acts on", options: ["The molecule an enzyme acts on", "A type of enzyme", "A product of reaction", "A coenzyme"], reason: "A substrate binds to an enzyme and is converted into a product." },
            { q: "What best describes an enzyme?", a: "Biological catalyst", options: ["Biological catalyst", "Chemical inhibitor", "Genetic material", "Energy carrier"], reason: "Enzymes are catalysts that increase reaction rates without being consumed." },
            { q: "Which term describes enzyme specificity?", a: "Lock and key model", options: ["Lock and key model", "Fluid mosaic model", "Cell theory", "Photosynthesis"], reason: "Enzyme specificity is explained by the lock and key model." },
            { q: "Which factor can slow down enzyme activity?", a: "Low temperature", options: ["Optimal pH", "Low temperature", "High enzyme concentration", "Correct substrate"], reason: "Lower temperatures reduce kinetic energy, slowing enzyme activity." },
            { q: "What is a coenzyme?", a: "A helper molecule for enzymes", options: ["A type of enzyme", "A sugar molecule", "A helper molecule for enzymes", "An energy source"], reason: "Coenzymes assist enzymes in catalyzing reactions." },
            { q: "What is the optimum pH for most human enzymes?", a: "Around 7", options: ["Around 3", "Around 5", "Around 7", "Around 9"], reason: "Most human enzymes function best at a neutral pH of 7." },
            { q: "What are enzymes made of?", a: "Proteins", options: ["Carbohydrates", "Proteins", "Lipids", "Nucleic acids"], reason: "Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biological reactions." },
            { q: "What term describes an enzyme that loses function due to high temperature?", a: "Denatured", options: ["Saturated", "Activated", "Denatured", "Hydrated"], reason: "High temperatures cause enzymes to lose their shape and function." },
            { q: "What binds to the active site of an enzyme?", a: "Substrate", options: ["Water", "Substrate", "Coenzyme", "Protein"], reason: "The substrate binds to the active site to undergo a reaction." },
            { q: "What happens when an enzyme reaches its saturation point?", a: "All active sites are full", options: ["Reaction stops", "All active sites are full", "Enzyme is destroyed", "Substrate stops binding"], reason: "At saturation, enzymes work at maximum capacity." },
            { q: "Which molecule inhibits enzyme activity?", a: "Inhibitor", options: ["Enzyme", "Inhibitor", "Substrate", "Product"], reason: "Inhibitors reduce enzyme activity by blocking the active site." }
